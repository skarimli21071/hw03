                <h2>About Our Project</h2>
                <p>Our team has been working on this website as part of our learning journey in coding. The website serves as a platform to showcase our efforts to bring coding education to students with our Hour of Code Event. It also underscores the importance of the web development in creating interactive and educational experiences.
                    This project allowed us to implement the skills we learned through Codecademy and other resources, helping us gain practical experience in web design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
