                <h2>About the Event</h2>
                <p>On November 6th, 2024, our team, composed of ADA University students Shukran Karimli, Aydan Misirzade, and Leyla Khanaliyeva, visited School No. 18 named after M. Mushfig in Baku, Azerbaijan. The main purpose of our visit was to host an <strong>Hour of Code</strong> event for 20 enthusiastic 6th grade students. The event was aimed at introducing coding to young students in an interactive and engaging way.</p>

                <h2>What We Did:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aydan,</strong> our main instructor, began by introducing the team and presenting the introductory slideshow, which lasted approximately 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Following the presentation, students were directed to <strong>Code.org</strong> to choose an activity, named <strong>Minecraft: Adventurer.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Aydan</strong> and <strong>Shukran</strong> explained the instructions and what the kids should do. However, instead of guiding students through each step as initially planned, we adapted to their enthusiasm to work independently on the exercises.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes students helped each other if they had already completed a task. If students had questions, they raised their hands, and one team member assisted them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leyla</strong> primarily focused on filming and capturing photos for documentation. Once she had sufficient footage, she joined the rest of the team in supporting the students.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the session, we presented certificates to each student, took group photos, and departed from the school.</li>
                </ul>
